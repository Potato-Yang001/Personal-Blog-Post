    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      I'm currently a student pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science,
      specializing in Software Engineering. Before this, I worked in system
      support, but I’ve always been curious about how software is built and that
      curiosity led me to learn programming. This is my first webpage using
      HTML.
